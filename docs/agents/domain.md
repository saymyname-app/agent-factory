# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root (single-context repo).
- **`docs/decisions/`**: read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in (this repo keeps its ADRs there, not in `docs/adr/`; pre-refactor ADRs are quarantined in `legacy/docs/decisions/` and read only when a live ADR cites them).

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal: either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/domain-modeling`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0025 (approved graph bootstrap scope), but worth reopening because…_
